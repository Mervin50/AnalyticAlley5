# 1. Introduction:
This README describes work done on the "Home Health Care Agencies" Dataset. Resources used include Python and associated packages Google Colab, matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, 
statsmodels, and SciPy. The analysis takes the form of a single Google Colab notebook of filename given above. To view this file, download it from this repository. All images intended for inclusion in 
this README are located in the images subdirectory of this repository. I have tried to structure the Google Colab notebook and this README so that they have corresponding sections. However, I do not wish 
to merely repeat here what has been stated in the notebook. I will endeavour to have this README summarize the work of the notebook and, hopefully, complement the analyses done there.
